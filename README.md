# syrup

Syrup is a simple Rails applications for libraries to enroll patrons in Summer Reading Programs. It's also a place for me to figure out what good Rails 4 code looks like.

## Setup
Syrup requires a running instance of Postgres to be setup

```
> bundle
> rake db:create db:migrate
```

## Running Tests

`rake` (or the more verbose `rake spec`) will run all tests.
